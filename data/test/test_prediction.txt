We spent the night here after a long tour day walking all day. The lobby was normal, the room to small to take a relax time.the tv is wrong angles for the audience but you can watch it. The bathroom was very very small. We almost couldn't take a shower or go to sit there ;) the best the prices. Good ones
The hostal is dirty. They don't offer you a towel (oh yeah), the sheets are nasty, the bathroom is gross, there's no hot water and the owner doesn't take dollars and couldn't give me receipt. Terrible
This place is to relax and enjoyable for any ages nice people to meet and the hostes they are extremely nice people Jose was very helpful on everything nice places to visits and always nice people to meet. The rooms was clean and wit comfortable. Nice and clean big rooms with shower.
